## OBJECTIVE
1. To develop a user-friendly medicine recommendation system using machine learning models that accurately suggests medications based on user-provided symptoms.
 
2. To provide personalized recommendations for medicines, prescriptions, diets and workout routines based on predicted diseases.

3. It can help healthcare professionals in prescribing the right medication to their patients, reducing the risk of adverse effects and improving patient outcomes.
# Project Overview:
The Medicine Recommendation System uses machine learning models to suggest medications based on user-provided symptoms. It is built with  Machine Learning algorithms and features a user-friendly frontend developed with HTML,CSS. The system offers accurate diagnosis predictions, providing an accessible tool for initial medical guidance.
# System Design:
Frontend: Use Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the chat interface.
Backend: Python (Flask) to process inputs and interact with the trained ML model.
Database: Store intents and medicine  info in CSV files.
